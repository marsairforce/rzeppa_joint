# rumdl configuration file

# Global configurations can be set here.
# By default, all rules are enabled.
[global]
# 'default': true in the JSON means all rules are on by default,
# which is also rumdl's default behavior, so no action is needed here.

# Rule-specific configurations are defined in their own tables.

# MD003: Header style (atx)
[MD003]
style = "atx"

# MD004: Unordered list style (consistent)
[MD004]
style = "consistent"

# MD007: Unordered list indentation
[MD007]

# MD013: Line length
[MD013]
line-length = 160
# In rumdl, code_blocks is a boolean, not an option within line_length
code-blocks = false
tables = false # You might want to disable line checking for tables too

# MD024: Multiple headings per section (siblings_only)
[MD024]
siblings-only = true

# MD046: Code block style (fenced)
[MD046]
style = "fenced"

# Disable specific rules globally if needed (equivalent to "rule-name": false in JSON)
[rules]
# "no-hard-tabs": false means you want to ignore MD010 (Hard tabs)
ignore = ["MD010", "MD009"]
# "whitespace": false broadly covers many rules, often MD009 (Trailing spaces)
# and potentially others. You may need to list all the specific rule IDs you want to ignore here.
